## Workshop Motivation and Description

### Motivation

Large language models (LLMs), when scaled from millions to billions of parameters, have been demonstrated to exhibit the so-called `emergence' effect, in that they are not only able to produce semantically correct and coherent text, but are also able to adapt themselves surprisingly well with small changes in contexts supplied as inputs (commonly called prompts).
Despite producing semantically coherent and potentially relevant text for a given context, LLMs are vulnerable to yield incorrect information. This misinformation generation, or the so-called hallucination problem of an LLM, gets worse when an adversary manipulates the prompts to their own advantage, e.g., generating false propaganda to disrupt communal harmony, generating false information to trap consumers with target consumables etc. Not only does the consumption of an LLM-generated hallucinated content by humans pose societal threats, such misinformation, when used as prompts, may lead to detrimental effects for in-context learning (also known as few-shot prompt learning).

### Description

With reference to the above-mentioned problems of LLM usage, in this workshop, Large Language Modelsâ€™ Interpretability and Trustworthiness (LLMIT), we intend to foster research on topics related to not only identifying misinformation from LLM-generated content, but also to mitigate the propagation effects of this generated misinformation on downstream predictive tasks thus leading to more robust and effective leveraging in-context learning.


Text can be **bold**, _italic_, or ~~strikethrough~~. OK

There should be whitespace between paragraphs.

There should be whitespace between paragraphs. We recommend including a README, or a file with information about your project.

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

##### Header 5

1.  This is an ordered list following a header.
2.  This is an ordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |
| out of stock | good and plenty   | nice  |
| ok           | good `oreos`      | hmm   |
| ok           | good `zoute` drop | yumm  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
